# Supper (PRE-ALPHA)

Supper lets you store inventory levels for multiple products in Shopify Product [metafields](http://docs.shopify.com/api/metafield). Specify your Shopify API/Supplier FTP credentials in YAML, and let Supper handle the REST.

Supper is written in Ruby and uses [the official Shopify API gem](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_api).
